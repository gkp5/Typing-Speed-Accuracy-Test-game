How It Works

The game loads a dictionary from /usr/share/dict/words (Unix-based systems) or a fallback word list (Windows users).

You select a difficulty level and number of words.

A random text sequence is generated based on the chosen settings.

You type the displayed text in the input field.

Your typing performance is monitored in real-time.

When completed, a results popup displays WPM, accuracy, and mistakes.

The game resets for a new challenge.

Difficulty Levels

Easy: Regular lowercase words.

Medium: Random capitalization in words.

Hard: Words with added punctuation.

Insane: Words with capitalization, punctuation, and symbols.
